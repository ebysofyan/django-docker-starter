## Boilerplate of Django project with Docker and PostgresSQL

Main purpose i create this repo is to make me easier to starting a new project without 
create a new project using `django-admin startproject` and then create `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose` 
and install so many dependency what my project needed using `pipenv`.

### What this starter contains?
1. Existing `django project` with separation `production` and `development` config.
2. Docker config
3. Pipenv file with existing a few dependency like `django`, `drf`, `pylint`, `pylint_django`, and other

### How to run?
If your operating system already installed with `docker` and `docker-compose`, you can execute this command</b>
`docker-compose up`

And .... waiting until docker finish to download the image.

### Happy Coding!!!
